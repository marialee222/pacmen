## PacMen Exercise
### PacMania Unleashed: Navigating the Maze of Randomized PacMen
Simulation link: [pacmen](https://marialee222.github.io/pacmen/)

## Description
The PacMan exercise is a simple interactive web application that allows users to create and control multiple PacMan characters on the screen. Users can add PacMan characters and start the game, with the added feature of controlling the characters' movements using keyboard arrow keys. The exercise aims to demonstrate basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills while providing an engaging and interactive user experience.

### Improvements
Updates made to enhance user experience and functionality:
- The primary improvement made was the addition of keyboard controls. The original exercise involved creating PacMan characters that move randomly on the screen when the "Start Game" button is clicked. The improvements include allowing users to interactively control the PacMan characters using keyboard arrow keys.

## Roadmap of Future Improvements
Future improvements for the PacMen Exercise include:
 - Scoring System:  Introduce a scoring mechanism to track points based on PacMan movements and interactions.
 - Game Over Conditions:  Implement conditions for game over, providing a more engaging gaming experience.
 - Advanced Animations:  Explore additional animation effects to make PacMan characters more visually appealing.
 - If  expand the styling or make the exercise more extensive, would consider creating a separate CSS file and linking it to the HTML file for better organization
